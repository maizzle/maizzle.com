# Button Component

The Button component makes it easy to add a styled link button to your HTML emails.

## Usage

The Button component is defined in `components/button.html`.

This enables the `<x-button>` tag, which you can use like this:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button href="https://example.com">
  Book now
</x-button>
```

You can use it anywhere you'd use a `<div>`.

## Customization

You can align the Button to the left, center or right, change its CSS styling, and adjust padding for Outlook on Windows.

### Href

Default: `undefined`

If you want the Button to link somewhere, you need to pass it the `href` prop:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button href="https://example.com">
  Book now
</x-button>
```

<Alert>The Button still renders if you don't pass `href`, but it will not include the `href` attribute on the `<a>` tag and might look broken in some email clients because of this.</Alert>

### Align

Default: `undefined`

You can align the Button to the left, center or right, through the `align` prop:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button align="center">
  Book now
</x-button>
```

This will add the `text-center` class to the button's wrapper `<div>`, which will align the `<a>` inside it to the center.

### Styling

You may style the Button as needed through props or with Tailwind CSS utilities.

The button includes a <span class="inline-flex gap-1 px-2 translate-y-0.5 border border-slate-200 border-solid rounded"><span class="w-3 h-3 mt-1.5 bg-indigo-700 rounded" title="#4338ca"></span><span class="text-sm/6">bg-indigo-700</span></span> background and <span class="inline-flex gap-1 px-2 translate-y-0.5 border border-slate-200 border-solid rounded"><span class="w-3 h-3 mt-1.5 border border-solid rounded bg-slate-50" title="#f8fafc"></span><span class="text-sm/6">text-slate-50</span></span> text color by default, which you can change through props.

For example, let's make the button blue-themed:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button
  href="https://example.com"
  color="#fffffe"
  bg-color="#1e65e1"
>
  Book now
</x-button>
```

You can also use Tailwind CSS utilities to set the text and background colors:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button
  href="https://example.com"
  class="bg-blue-500 text-white"
>
  Book now
</x-button>
```

Of course, you may also change the colors directly in `components/button.html`.

### MSO Padding

Top and bottom padding for Outlook on Windows is controlled through `letter-spacing` and `mso-text-raise`, a proprietary Outlook CSS property.

This technique is based on the Link Button from [goodemailcode.com](https://www.goodemailcode.com/email-code/link-button).

#### MSO top padding

Default: `16px`

Adjust the top padding for Outlook on Windows with the `mso-pt` prop:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button mso-pt="12px">
  Book now
</x-button>
```

#### MSO bottom padding

Default: `31px`

Adjust the bottom padding for Outlook on Windows with the `mso-pb` prop:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button mso-pb="24px">
  Book now
</x-button>
```

### Other attributes

You may pass any other HTML attributes to the component, such as `data-*` or `id` - they will all be added to the `<a>` tag.

Note that non-standard attributes will be ignored by default - you'll need to define them as props in the component if you need them preserved. Alternatively, you can [safelist](/docs/configuration/components#safelistattributes) them in your `build.components` config.

## Responsive

To override Button styling on small viewports, use Tailwind CSS utilities.

For example, let's make the button full-width on small viewports:

```html [emails/example.html]
<x-button class="sm:block">
  Book now
</x-button>
```

## Alternatives

There are other ways to create buttons in your HTML emails, such as by using a `<table>`. Check out our [Button examples](/docs/examples/buttons) for more ideas.
