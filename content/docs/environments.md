# Environments

> When I run `maizzle build [environment]`, should CSS be inlined? Should my HTML be minified? Do I need to make some data available to the templates?

You might want to use different settings when developing locally versus when building the production-ready emails.

For example, you don't need CSS inlining or code indentation when developing on your computer, but you'll want both enabled for the final, production-ready emails.

Maizzle makes it easy to define as many build scenarios as you need, by using distinct configuration files that enable their own build command.

We call these Environments.

## Default Environments

Maizzle comes with two config files, each enabling its own build command:

| File                   | Command                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `config.js`            | `maizzle build`<br>`maizzle serve`                       |
| `config.production.js` | `maizzle build production`<br>`maizzle serve production` |

You probably noticed the link between <span class="font-mono text-sm">config.<strong>production</strong>.js</span> and <span class="font-mono text-sm">maizzle build <strong>production</strong></span> - the keyword in the config file name enables its own build command.

<Alert>Remember, the `maizzle` executable will only be available if you installed the [CLI tool](/docs/cli) globally. Otherwise, use the NPM scripts provided by the Starter in `package.json`.</Alert>

### Config file naming

You may use the `maizzle.config.js` configuration file naming pattern if you prefer:

| File                           | Command                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `maizzle.config.js`            | `maizzle build`<br>`maizzle serve`                       |
| `maizzle.config.production.js` | `maizzle build production`<br>`maizzle serve production` |

### CJS config

If you need to use CommonJS with `module.exports` and `require()` in your Maizzle config file, you'll need to change the file extension to `.cjs`:

| ESM                            | CJS                             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `config.js`                    | `config.cjs`                    |
| `config.production.js`         | `config.production.cjs`         |
| `maizzle.config.js`            | `maizzle.config.cjs`            |
| `maizzle.config.production.js` | `maizzle.config.production.cjs` |


### Data merging

Any new Environment configuration file that you create will be merged _on top_ of the base `config.js` when you run the build command for that particular Environment.

With the example above, when running the `maizzle build production` command, `config.production.js` will be merged on top of the base `config.js`: if the same key is present in both files, the value from `config.production.js` will be used.

<Alert>When creating a new Environment config file you only need to specify the config values that will be different from those (or don't exist) in `config.js`.</Alert>
<Alert type="warning">`build.content` keys are not merged, so that each Environment sources its own files to compile.</Alert>

## Environment builds

To build your emails for a specific Environment, pass its name as an argument to the `maizzle build` command:

```sh
maizzle build production
```

The Starter's `config.production.js` is configured to output production-ready emails in a `build_production` folder at the root of the project.

<Alert type="warning">In this example, if a `config.production.js` file is not found at the current location, the build will fail.</Alert>

## Custom Environments

You may create as many Environments as you need, and name them as you like.

For example, you might create a config file named `config.shopify.js` that you would use to build only the templates from the `emails/shopify` folder:

```js [config.shopify.js]
export default {
  build: {
    content: ['emails/shopify/**/*.html'],
    output: {
      path: 'build_shopify'
    }
  }
}
```

The build command for it would be:

```sh
maizzle build shopify
```

Or, if you're using NPM scripts and didn't set up a script for this Environment:

```sh
npm run build -- shopify
```


## Config variables

Maizzle exposes a `page` object that you can access through [expressions](/docs/expressions) in your HTML.

This object contains the computed Template config, which is based on `config.[env].js` merged with Front Matter variables from the Template currently being processed.

This makes it possible to define variables in `config.js`:

```js [config.js]
export default {
  doctype: 'html'
}
```

... and use them in your markup:

```hbs [emails/example.html]
<x-main>
  <p>doctype is: {{ page.doctype }}</p>
</x-main>
```

### Current Environment

The current Environment name is globally available under the `page.env` variable.

You can output content in your emails based on the Environment that you're building for:

```hbs [emails/example.html]
<if condition="page.env === 'production'">
  This will show only when running `maizzle build production`
</if>
```

<Alert>You may also use the `<env:production>` tag, [see the docs](/docs/tags#env).</Alert>

### Top-level variables

You may define 'local' variables that can be accessed outside of the `page` object:

```js [config.js]
export default {
  locals: {
    company: {
      name: 'Spacely Space Sprockets, Inc.'
    }
  }
}
```

These local variables can be accessed without `page`:

```html [emails/example.html] {2}
  Company name is {{ page.company.name }} <!-- [!code --] -->
  Company name is {{ company.name }} <!-- [!code ++] -->
```

<Alert type="warning">Maizzle does not allow overwriting the `page` object through `locals`.</Alert>

## Top-level await

You may use top-level `await` in your `config.js` to fetch data from an API:

```js [config.js]
const data = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos').then(res => res.json())

/** @type {import('@maizzle/framework').Config} */
export default {
  todos: data,
  build: {
    /* ... */
  },
}
```

## Environment attribute values

Sometimes you may need to define different values for attributes based on the Environment you're building for.

While you could use long, verbose ternaries in expressions to do so:

```hbs [emails/example.html]
<x-main>
  <a href="{{ page.env === 'production' ? 'https://example.com' : 'https://dev.example.com' }}">Link</a>
</x-main>
```

... Maizzle also supports Environment-based attributes:

```hbs [emails/example.html]
<x-main>
  <a
    href="https://dev.example.com"
    href-production="https://example.com"
  >Link</a>
</x-main>
```

The value of the `href-production` attribute will be used for the `href` attribute when doing `npm run build` or `maizzle build production`.

The `href-production` attribute itself will then be removed from the output.
